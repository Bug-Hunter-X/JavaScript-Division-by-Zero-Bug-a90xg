# JavaScript Division by Zero Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: incorrectly handling division by zero. The `bug.js` file contains a function that returns 0 when either input is 0, which can lead to unexpected results. The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to correct the error by using a `try-catch` block to handle potential errors caused by division by zero.
